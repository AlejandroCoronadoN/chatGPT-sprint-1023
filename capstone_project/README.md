# ChatGPT-Sprint Capstone Project

Welcome to the &ldquo;ChatGPT-Sprint&rdquo; capstone project located within the \`capstone<sub>project</sub>\` directory. This sprint guides you through understanding and effectively integrating the ChatGPT API into your development endeavors. By its conclusion, you&rsquo;ll have crafted a unique tool that harnesses the ChatGPT API, utilizing the module we&rsquo;ve provided as a foundation.


<a id="orgb16e742"></a>

## Getting Started

Before plunging into the project:

-   Equip yourself with a basic understanding of Python (or another ChatGPT API-supported language).
-   Set up your development environment (e.g., Python environment, code editor).
-   Procure an OpenAI API key from [OpenAI&rsquo;s platform](https://www.openai.com/).
-   IMPORTANT: Place your API key within a \`.env\` file as \`API<sub>KEY</sub>=your<sub>actual</sub><sub>key</sub><sub>here</sub>\`. This ensures your credentials remain private and are not unintentionally shared.
